Numerical study of the theory of quaternions in economic analysis
The purpose of the thesis project is a numerical study of the theory of quaternions in economic analysis. Within the framework of the project, the properties and possibilities of using quaternions for modeling and analyzing economic processes were studied. Special attention is paid to the introduction of quaternion mathematics into data processing and visualization, which allows us to identify multidimensional dependencies and improve the accuracy of forecasting.
